Testing-Library makes it easy to get started with testing. But even then, it can still be challenging to find the right queries or to understand why an element isn't being matched.

Testing-Playground provides you with direct feedback. Trying to visualize the direct impact of adding and removing specific (aria) attributes. All to give you some visual support while learning about the importance of aria roles, labels, and attributes.
